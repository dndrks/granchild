# granchild

sequence sample granules

granchild is a granular grandchild. this script was born out of and inspired by @cfdrake's innovative twine and @justmat's inspiring mangl, both themselves based on @artfwo's amazing glut script. thus, i consider this script to be a grandchild of @artfwo's script, and child of the other two - merging some of the things from @cfdrake's twine (randomization in parameters) and some things from @justmat's script (lfos, greyhole integration).




## Todo

- [ ] Merge ZGlut with Kolor
- [ ] Implement LFOs on every parameter (within the clock parameters)
- [ ] Add step sequencer mode with lattice
- [ ] Synchronize lattice on arngulator with kolor
