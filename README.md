granchild - sequence granulations

this script was born out of and inspired by @cfdrake's innovative twine and @justmat's inspiring mangl, both themselves based on @artfwo's amazing glut engine. so i consider this to be a grandchild of @artfwo's script, merging some of the things from @cfdrake (randomization in parameters) and some things from @justmat's script (lfos, greyhold integration). since its a granular grandchild of all these great scripts i call it "granchild".



## Todo

- [ ] Merge ZGlut with Kolor
- [ ] Implement LFOs on every parameter (within the clock parameters)
- [ ] Add step sequencer mode with lattice
- [ ] Synchronize lattice on arngulator with kolor
